## 1. Printing Images
In this section, we explored how to load and display images using Python libraries such as OpenCV and Matplotlib. This foundational step allows us to visualize our data before processing.

## 2. Print Minimum and Maximum Pixel Values
We analyzed the pixel values of the images by determining the minimum and maximum intensity values. This step helps in understanding the dynamic range and contrast of the images.

## 3. Convert to Grayscale
We converted color images to grayscale. Grayscale images simplify processing tasks by reducing dimensionality, making it easier to analyze intensity variations without the complexity of color channels.

## 4. Resizing
Images were resized to a uniform dimension (e.g., 256x256 pixels). This standardization is crucial for consistent processing, especially in machine learning applications where input sizes must match.

## 5. Scaling and Normalization
We scaled and normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1]. This transformation improves the performance of various algorithms by ensuring that pixel values are within a consistent range, particularly for neural networks.

## 6. Applying Gaussian Filter
A Gaussian filter was applied to reduce noise and smooth the images. This technique helps in preserving edges while blurring other details, making it useful for further image analysis.

## 7. Histogram Equalization
We performed histogram equalization to enhance the contrast of images. This method redistributes pixel intensity values, making features more discernible and improving overall image quality.

## 8. Denoising Images
Denoising techniques were employed to reduce unwanted noise in the images. We used Gaussian filtering to achieve a cleaner output, facilitating better feature extraction and analysis.

## 9. Conclusion
Through this lab, we have engaged in various digital image processing techniques and exploratory analysis. We are thrilled to have been part of this lab experience. The hands-on work has greatly enhanced our understanding of image processing concepts, and we are learning immensely through practical applications.
